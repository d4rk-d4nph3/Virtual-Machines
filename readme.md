There are two flavors of Kanjante both based on *Ubuntu 18.04 LTS*. This distro is chosen due to being very *stable* for packages and tools needed in our task.

* Kanjante
This is the minimal Ubuntu install with no unnecessary packages. This is used to create more featured VM depending upon the need of the user.

* Kanjante-NSM
This is based on *Kanjante* and is focused on Network Security Monitoring(NSM). It comes with preinstalled tools such as:
1. Suricata 5.0.2 Stable
2. Zeek(Bro) 3.1.1 
3. Wireshark 3.2.2 Stable
4. Fail2Ban 
5. Sublime Text 3

*More to be added later on.*
